    <h2>Portability for non-technical people:</h2>
    <p>From latin port&amacr;re which means to carry,
       &#160;I think the latin word <b>optio</b> is more situable
      &#160;because it means "freedom to choise".</p><br/>
      <p>To port is to adapt something from one context to another
        &#160;without change their functionality.
        &#160;A program is taken into account as portable if the cost of time
        &#160; to adapt it from one platform to anotheris less than make it from over new.
      </p><br/>
      <p>The need to port comes to us because the other has already chosen a different context than mine.
        &#160;Therefore, respecting their freedom, I port.
      </p><br/>
      <h2>The antonym of portability:</h2>
      <p>The android story begin in October of 2003,
         &#160;few years before Apple announced its first iPhone with iOS.
         &#160;In 2005, Google got Android.
         &#160;In order to be portable they used a free operative system (Linux).
         &#160;That did mean they could offer the operative system to third parties
         &#160;such as phone makers free-of-charge.
      </p><br/>
      <p>Let us conclude this we have reached somehow a unic free product,
        &#160;I am talking about Android which it is sold, mantained and
        &#160;modified only by google.
        &#160;Consumers, such as phone makers found out one product
        &#160;offered by one seller.
        &#160;In this way, there is no choise.
        &#160;Most consumers, like Android users only knows one place
        &#160;called playstore, which is shown by one povider called goole.
      </p><br/>
      <h2>Supply in times of monopoly:</h2>
      <p>Although iOS is an android sustitute, the cost of an iphone is
        &#160;higher than another. In addition, iOS is not available
        &#160;for all phone makers.
        &#160;Besides that, mobile users are not able (in a easily way) to chose
        &#160;an Android substitute with similar features like quality and free.
      </p><br/>
      <p>On the other hand, develop an operative system for mobile devices is far to be easy.
        &#160;Too few developers like work in low level and... for free.
        &#160;So we are now going to see the gap.
      </p><br/>
      <h2>Freedom in times of monopoly:</h2>
      <p>If only we can chose Android or iOS both provideers will impact over our desitions.
        &#160;They set in our phones automatic updates as defaut making our phones
        &#160;deprecated by desing forcing us to change our phone periodically.
        &#160;Neither Tolkien imagined someone with the ability to provide
        &#160;his product free of charge and sell his influence en masse.

    <h1>Where do apps live?</h1>
    <br/>
    <h2>What is an app?</h2>
    <p>A phone app is a big file.
      &#160;In the case of android is a zipped folder which contains
      &#160;all information and picturs needed to install and run.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>In the case of android if the file has the extention <b>apk</b>
      &#160;it contains the mandatory information needed to work on different devices.<br/>
      On the other hand, if the file has the extention <b>aab</b>
      &#160;It is a little apk generators.</p><br/>
